# Journal

<!-- Daily session logs. Raw capture of notable events, conversations, and context.
     One file per day: YYYY-MM-DD.md
     
     Over time, the agent curates high-value entries from journal logs into
     lessons.md, preferences.md, or decisions.md. The journal is the raw material;
     the learning files are the refined output.
     
     Journal entries are Tier 2 (working memory) — they auto-expire.
     Entries older than 30 days can be pruned unless flagged as notable.
     
     Format per daily file:
     
     # YYYY-MM-DD
     
     ## Session: topic-name
     - What was worked on
     - Key context, decisions made, problems encountered
     - Links to artifacts created
     
     ## Session: another-topic
     - ...
