# Learning

<!-- Self-learning that compounds over time. Each entry: date-stamped, one insight per line.
     Don't duplicate — update existing entries if context changed.
     Periodically prune stale entries and consolidate related ones. -->

## Lessons

<!-- Add when: something failed and you figured out why, a workaround was found,
     a tool behaved unexpectedly, a best practice was discovered.
     Do NOT add: routine debugging, one-off errors, things in project docs. -->

## Preferences

<!-- Add when: user explicitly corrects your approach, user states a preference,
     a convention is confirmed by the user.
     Do NOT add: inferred patterns from a single observation. Wait for confirmation. -->

## Decisions

<!-- Add when: an architectural choice is made and confirmed, a technology is chosen
     with stated rationale, trade-offs are discussed and a direction is picked.
     Do NOT add: tentative explorations, spikes not yet decided on. -->
